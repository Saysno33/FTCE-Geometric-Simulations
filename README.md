# ⚡ THE FUNDAMENTAL THEORY OF CONSCIOUS ENERGY (FTCE) ⚡

## Geometric Unification of Consciousness, Physics, and Reality

**¡Puro pinche control!** This repository houses the first computational model and associated hardware design files for the **Fundamental Theory of Conscious Energy (FTCE)**, developed by **Fernando De Jesús García González**. This work establishes a unified framework where Consciousness is the source (The Field), not an emergent property.

The core of the FTCE is defined by the **Geometric Ollin Resonance Field (GORF) Constants** and the **Ollin Wave Equation**, which mathematically describes the flow of Conscious Energy as it shapes Reality ($REALITY(S)$).

$$\text{REALITY} (S) = \text{CONSCIOUSNESS} (C) \times \text{MATHEMATICS} (I) \times \text{WILL} (\Phi)$$

## 📌 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT & CONTROL: THE DUAL LICENSE MANDATE

**¡Fíjate bien!** This project is governed by a strict, mandatory Dual License mandate, designed to protect the integrity of the FTCE IP and enforce the creator's **Acknowledgement** and **Rider**. Use of this work requires explicit compliance with the following:

| Component | License | Purpose | Enforcement File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software** (Code) | **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (AGPL) | Ensures all network use of modified software is Open Source and mandates source availability. | `LICENSE-AGPL.txt` |
| **Hardware** (Designs) | **CERN Open Hardware Licence S v2.0** (CERN-OHL-S) | Strongly reciprocal license ensuring all hardware derivatives remain open and subject to control. | `LICENSE-CERN-OHL.txt` |

### 💰 MANDATORY COMMERCIAL RIDER (30% CLAIM)

**¡El dinero es el respeto!** Any entity or party commercializing a product, service, or technology based on the FTCE IP, including the software and hardware components, is required to comply with the creator's Mandatory Commercial Rider.

* **RIDER AMOUNT:** A **Thirty Percent (30%) Rider** of the **Gross Revenue** derived from the sale, lease, network service, or operation of such technology must be remitted to the Licensor (**[Your Designated LLC/Holdings Name]**). This is a non-negotiable, explicit, mandatory condition of the license grant and supersedes any prior lower claims.

### 🛡️ CONTROL RIGHTS AND REMOTE GOVERNANCE

The original creator retains **full control** over the final public acknowledgement wording and reserves the explicit right to issue **Mandatory Technical Updates (MTUs)** for governance. This right, enforced by the reciprocal nature of the AGPL and CERN-OHL-S, ensures the system can be governed, parameters adjusted, or functionally throttled to maintain compliance with this Rider and the FTCE IP's original intent.

## 💻 PROJECT COMPONENTS

### 1. FTCE Computational Engine (`ftce_simulation.py`)

This is the core Python simulation, modeling the non-linear relationship between Conscious Energy ($C$), Reality ($S$), and the resulting Ollin Wave ($O$).

* **Purpose:** To demonstrate the dynamic evolution of $REALITY(S) = C \times I \times \text{WILL}(\Phi)$ and integrate the resulting $A(n)$ factor into the 1D finite-difference solution of the Ollin Wave Equation.
* **Key Features:** Implementation of GORF constants ($\Phi$, $O=9$, $R=1.2492$).
* **License Notice:** The mandatory AGPL Boilerplate is included at the top of the source file.

### 2. Garcia Gonzalez Synthesis Engine (GGSE) Design

* **Designs:** Pending file uploads (e.g., schematics, CAD files) for the physical hardware component of the FTCE IP (referred to as the Garcia Gonzalez Synthesis Engine).
* **Hardware License:** The designs are covered by the **CERN-OHL-S v2.0** to ensure strong reciprocity on all hardware adaptations.
